# Financial & Economic Data Beginner Project

Welcome to the **Financial & Economic Data Beginner Project**!  
This project is designed as a hands-on introduction to real-world financial data analysis for beginners. You will learn how to load, clean, visualize, and model financial and economic data using Python in a Jupyter/Colab notebook.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `finance_econ_analysis.ipynb` &mdash; Main analysis notebook (open in Jupyter or Google Colab)
- `finance_economics_dataset.csv` &mdash; Financial and economic dataset (you provide/upload it)

---

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

- Loading and cleaning real-world datasets
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization (trends, distributions, correlations)
- Feature correlation analysis
- Predicting stock closing prices using a basic linear regression model

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

All required packages are installed automatically in the notebook if you use Google Colab.

## 📝 Instructions

1. **Open the Notebook**  
   Open `finance_econ_analysis.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for the best experience.

2. **Upload the Dataset**  
   Upload your `finance_economics_dataset.csv` using the provided code cell.  
   The notebook will guide you through all necessary steps.

3. **Run Each Cell**  
   Go through the notebook step-by-step, running each cell and reviewing the outputs.

4. **Explore and Experiment!**  
   Try changing parameters, visualizations, or experimenting with different models as you learn.

## 📊 Example Analyses

- Time series plots of closing prices for each stock index
- Summary statistics and missing value handling
- Correlation heatmaps
- Building and evaluating a simple linear regression model

---

## 💡 Notes

- The dataset should include at least these columns: `Date`, `Stock Index`, `Close Price`, and other economic/financial indicators.
- If you use your own data, ensure it matches the expected structure or adapt the code accordingly.
